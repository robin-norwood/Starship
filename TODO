o Switch to radians throughout instead of converting deg->rad all the time.

o Move handling of 'pieces' (bullets, target shards, etc) into
  starship.js main event loop instead of handling all the logic in the
  container entity. ('MultipartEntity' base class?)

o Fix edge-rendering issues (maybe by drawing 2 or 3 copies of the object)

o Draw stars with ImageData instead of fillRect
 * Unfortunately, accessing ImageData is very, very slow on Firefox 3.6

o Fix multi-line message handling (line spacing is hard coded)

o Gravity

o Collisions

o Multiplayer

o More 'stuff'. Ships, weapons, asteroids, planets, sounds, music, blah blah blah


--DONE--

o Fix bullet acceleration bug.
