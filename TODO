o Move handling of 'pieces' (bullets, target shards, etc) into
  starship.js main event loop (instead of handling all the logic in the
  container entity).

o Draw stars with ImageData instead of fillRect

o Fix multi-line message handline (line spacing is hard coded)

o Gravity

o Collisions

o Multiplayer

o More 'stuff'. Ships, weapons, asteroids, planets, sounds, music, blah blah blah
