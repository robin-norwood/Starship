StarShip - An HTML 5 game.

This simple game is my personal project to learn a little about HTML 5
and JavaScript.  It uses <canvas>, <audio>, and JQuery.

The code is my own, and available under the GPL, see COPYING for details.

The sounds and music are acquired from various sources, and available
under creative commons licenses.  See attrib.txt for details.
